## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Able to get notifications, dark mode, and image uploading in development mode to work.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 When deploying with Surge/Heroku, some of these new features are buggy / only work sometimes.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, now we just need to make sure everything is working for deployment and hopefully we don't have to make any drastic changes.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, twilio was used for the notifications and some of the mentors advised me to use certain tools such as S3 Buckets in AWS for image uploading.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 None. We achieved all the ones we needed to hit.
