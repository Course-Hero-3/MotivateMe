## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to make our application accessible and responsive which was done using media queries and looking at color palettes.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We had many problems doing certain pages such as dashboard. Also, some issues were only showing up in deployment so it was hard to debug.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, we finished all the tasks for the sprint plan this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, at this point since we are so close to the end we haven't gained additional resources but the resources given to us from prior weeks has continued to help us such as bootstrap and chakra.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None.
