## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
- The pacing of the capstone project was just right. We were giving 5 weeks. Myself and my pod members immediately went to work to plan what features that needed to be implemented that week and so on. We even did some late night coding to stay on course, time wise. Regardless, we were able to complete all of our core and stretch features.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
- The plan changed when we realized that we were implementing all of our features very quickly. Since we were putting more time into this project, the stretch features became part of the core features. We were just grinding out this project to make it the best that we could learning from the past 10 weeks.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
- The labs and weekly assignments were very helpful in preparing us for this capstone project. Some topics that Gikai has questions for would probably have to deal with more of the backend topics, but it was because he wasn't really understanding it. Regardless, the TAs recognized that issue and was very helpful to him. 

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
- Honestly, everything. With the mentors, instructors and TAs, they were able to guide us to resources we can use for our capstone project like some 3rd party libraries and authentifications. With the pod syncs, our mentors would view our websites and give us feedback on what to change in order to satisfy the user. The wireframes allowed us to visualize what our project would look like and of course expand in case we wanted to add some of the new features we thought of. THe sprint planning kept us organized on what to work on for that week and so on. If we kept going into the next sprints, then it would stress us out which we didn't want. Bug bash was super helpful in order to realize what specific features or CSS changes were broken so we can fix them. Finally, practice demo day allowed to figure out our presentation and demo between the 3 of us. We knew our timing and pacing between the presnetation and demo itself so it could be perfect on the actual demo day.
