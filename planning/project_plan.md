# Project Plan

Pod Members: **Stephane Mbenga, Kian Ranjbar, Gikai Andrews**

## Problem Statement and Description

Problem Statement: Student planners can be boring and stressful to look at, especially if the schedule is constantly packed and seems to be never-ending. Why not add a bit of motivation to keep students up and running? Besides organizing their school life, MotivateMe allows users to see fun stats on previous tasks they have completed in order to keep them motivated. From wanting to increase their test scores to simply maintaining their already adequate project scores, students have something to look forward to besides an ugly transcript.

Description: MotivateMe allows users to create accounts in order to be able to access their information anywhere as long as they are connected to the internet! After logging in, users can see their Dashboard which briefly displays a small amount of upcoming tasks they have planned, as well as some statistics to see their previous performances in certain categories. In the To-Do Page, users can add, remove, update, and complete tasks. It also shows a full view of all upcoming tasks. The last feature that makes our app stand out is our Recap Page which shows graphs, charts, and other visualizations of the user's statistics in hopes to motivate them to continue doing well, or perhaps motivate them to do better.

## User Roles and Personas

User Roles:
* Student: A scholar who wants to organize their schedule and log assignments

User Personas:

* James: James is an incoming freshman at Cornell University and will be majoring in computer science. In highschool hestruggled to keep track of assignments he needed to complete and was overwhelmed most of the time. He has never had a system for staying organized in terms of his assignments, homeworks, and exams but wants to change and stay organized to take some stress off his shoulders and do better in college. 
   
* Jonathan: Jonathan is well into his third year at the University of Michigan, and gets demotivated when he is assigned work for his classes. He wishes he was more motivated and inspired to start his work early and finish on or before the deadlines.

* Owen Wilson is a student at Saddleback Community College who just recently came back from a one year break. However, he forgot how fast paced school was and since he wants to transfer by summer, he can’t afford to fail any of his classes. Therefore, he downloaded MotivateMe on his laptop in order to keep an agenda of his things. He is a business major so every morning he usually goes on his laptop to complete material online, and that is when he enters items he needs to do, as well as the items he has completed the previous day. He is familiar with technology as he is 20 years old so navigating around the app is not a problem. Some potential pain points may be that he cannot access it on his mobile device on the go.

* Stephany is a very smart student-athlete at UCLA who plays water polo and never has free time. Whether it’s competitive matches or extremely hard tests, she’s always booked. She majors in cognitive science with hopes of becoming a pediatrician later on after graduating with her Bachelor’s. After showing up to one of her classes on the third week of the quarter, and not knowing there was a test, she failed a test for the first time in her life. As a preventive measure, she started using MotivateMe on her dorm computer to keep track of her sport, education, and personal life. After 2 months of using it, she never missed another test, and she continued to never miss a practice. However, since Stephany travels a lot, she isn’t at her dorm everyday. However, since the app is on a cloud, she can access her account on any other laptop or computer.
